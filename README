pacmoon is a script for compiling packages and their dependencies from 
a tree of recipes.

The tool was made to run on Arch Linux, but this fork is made to run 
mainly on Crux Linux, or any other distribution using the pkgutils. In
the future, we hope to modularize pacmoon enough to make it work on
several distributions.

To use this fork of pacmoon, you need to install the usagi zsh library 
providing the `jgetopts` tool, and `pkg++`.

Any help, suggestion or bug report is welcome. :)
