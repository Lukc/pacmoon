    pacmoon is a script for compiling arch linux packages using custom make flags. It keeps track of which files have been compiled so that in the event of compiled packages getting replaced with a binary (like during an upgrade process) then pacmoon can recompile only the necessary packages.
}

%h2 Running pacmoon
%pre <<EOF
    pacmoon 0.8 (please enjoy your evening)
    usage: ./pacmoon [arguments] [packages]
      --ask, -a         ask for confirmation before compiling
      --pretend, -p     only print what would be done
      --keep-going, -k  do not stop on error
      --verbose, -v     increase verbosity
      --quiet, -q       hide output of compilation
      --keep-build, -b  keep temporary build files
      --no-abs, -A      do not use local abs mirror (slower)
      --uncompiled, -u  list packages which have not been custom compiled
      --make-deps, -m   compile make dependencies rather than using binaries
      --compiled, -c    list packages which have been custom compiled
      --list, -l        list installed packages with their compilation status
      --help, -h        show this help message

%pre <<EOF
    % pacmoon zsh gcc nasm
     * please wait, collecting packages to build
    binaries installed due to make dependencies:

     * mercurial
    pacmoon install list:
     * zsh
